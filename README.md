> Tasks for [MRM](https://github.com/sapegin/mrm) to aid in setting up software projects.

## Usage

```sh
# Install the preset globally
npm i -g @thorough/mrm-tasks

# Then run with npx mrm (or a local version of mrm)
npx mrm typescript --preset @thorough/mrm-tasks
```

### Included tasks

Our preset includes several tasks that are handy for starting new projects.
While we generally have a specific stack we prefer, we've strived to make the
tasks as flexible as possible, reading your existing codebase and adjusting
based on any existing patterns or tools you seem to be using.

- [`typescript`](./typescript/)
- [`babel`](./babel/)
